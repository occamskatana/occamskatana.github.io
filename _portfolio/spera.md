## Explanation

Spera is both a mobile application and web application that allows substance abuse patients stay in touch with their treatment centers and support network, and helps the treatment centers treat their patients in an aftercare scope.

## Problem

Last year, 47,055 people died from drug overdoses -- 1.5 times greater than the number killed in car crashes. There is currently no unified technological effort to reduce this rate.  

## Solution

The founders of the company interviewed hundreds of people including director level employees at drug addiction foundations and came up with a spec that would be effective according to their research. I built the Rails Server and API, as well as the Spera front end with AngularJS and Ionic, and presented a MVP in two weeks. 

## Results

Currently, this is a work in progress, as you can see from the screenshot. With further feedback from the cofounders and researchers, this will be developed into a full production quality application.

> Although it is a work in progress, we have gotten a bunch of awesome feedback from people in recovery, investors, and the directors of the product. 

The rest of the spec will be completed within a week

## Conclusion

I look forward to continuing to work closely with our investors, researchers, and patients to develop a product to really help people.
