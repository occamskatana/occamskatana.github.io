## Explanation

Open Todo is a backend framework for a To-Do list that is designed to work with any front-end language or framework that uses json. 

## Problem

This was mainly a tool for me to wean myself off of the full Rails framework and start to work more with a decoupled back end using Rails, while planning to implement a front end later. I find that this backend offers enough flexibility through its API that I could offer it as a boilerplate piece of code for anyone learning a frontend framework like Angular to use in order to persist changes. 

## Solution

Open Todo ended up being a simple REST API with a SQL storage solution that allows users to quickly build the frontend app using the framework of their choice, without having to put up with the hassle of coming up with their own backend solution.

## Results

By using a consumable REST API, I made a hasslefree platform. I will use this platform in the upcoming months to continue developing my AngularJS and Ionic skills. 


## Conclusion

Overall, I learned a lot about the benefits of builing a discreet API into any web application I make in order to make it a platform, rather than just a web application.
