## Explanation

Blocitoff is another twist on the classic todo list app. In this iteration, I learned rake automation within the Rails framework in order to knock old tasks off the list within a certain amount of time - 7 days. 

## Problem

Todo lists often get cluttered with unnecessary items that never get done or checked off. 

## Solution

I cleared that up with the fact that automated rake tasks clear the list of old items after 7 days. 

## Results

The list, although a simple project, turned out to be a great learning experience. I was able to get down a bit deeper into the Rails framework to further understand it. I can see many uses for rake automation in the future. 

> Wrestling with Javascript and JQuery, although frustrating, in the end allowed me to further understand how a DOM operates and is manipulated. 

I want to expand my todo list to be wired up with my other mentioned project - OpenTodo. I would like to work further with cross site request scripting and learn about securing these requests. 

## Conclusion

I look forward to using rake automation and cross site request scripting to build some really dynamic web applications in the future.
