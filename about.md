Welcome to my page. I am a racecar driver turned web developer. I have worked in the Technology industry since 2007, when I started and operated a company that provided IT services to small to medium size businesses. I have experience with Ruby, Rails, AngularJS, and Ionic.

In keeping with my personal philosophy of using technology to help people and make the world a better place, I currently work for Spera, a healthcare company based in Tennessee. I am currently helping them develop their MVP to demo to investors using Ionic, AngularJS, and a Rails backend. 

I am having a blast with my career in web development!.
