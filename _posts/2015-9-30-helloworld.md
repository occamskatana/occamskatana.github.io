title: Starting my Journey
---
I'm going to start by saying it: I'm a chronic activity hopper. What does this mean? I started driving racecars at the age of 17, have pursued a professional career doing it. When that got boring for me, I cut back on it and founded an IT outsourcing solutions company in 2008 called Evolution Technology, which I later abandoned to go to college and to continue my pursuit of race driving. When I came across web development, I was instantly fascinated. I wanted to pursue it for three major reasons. 

* I like things that I find challenging
* The money is good
* The entrepreneurial opportunities are unlimited

There was a problem though - I didn't know where to start. Without knowing whether I could even learn web development, I enrolled in Bloc's Full Stack Web Developer track. Right off the bat, I was thrust into the world of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 

I thought my biggest challenge would be the syntax of the code language. From day one, I learned quickly that my biggest challenge would be *learning to think like a programmer*. I love the world of programming. When tasked with solving a problem, my initial attempts turned out to be veritable Rube-Goldberg machines compared to the elegant code that more experienced developers write. 

I found that I didn't quite know how it all fit together. That quickly changed when I learned Ruby on Rails. Soon I was buildling toy apps with no problem! Fast forward 5 months and I have built multiple Production Ready Web Application using Ruby on Rails! Although I fell as if I'm finally starting to get a hold of what's going on, one lesson continues to permeate everything I do - 

> Always keep learning - there is always someone better than you out there to learn from

Lately, I have been working with AngularJS and Ionic with a Rails backend in order to help a healthcare company in Tennessee develop their first mental healthcare app! It has been an absolute pleasure to get started on my journey into web development, and although I may be a chronic activity hopper, I think I'll stick with this one for quite a while.
