title: Working With Spera
---

Having been well on my way developing Rails Applications, a brand new company out of Tennessee named Spera offered me a unique position helping them develop their mobile application in order to help people with substance abuse and mental health issues get better. This is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. Over the past few years of dealing with chronic pain from racecar crashes and injuries, I have felt the siren's song of addiction in my ear and have met many people that struggle with serious substance abuse problems - quite a few of them are dead today.

If this first paragraph comes off as hyperbolic, trust me, it isn't. The United States consumes 75 percent of the world's drugs, while only comprising about 5 percent of its population. The mental healthcare system is overrun and underfunded. For the first time in history, the life expectancy of white males has gone down in the country, mainly due to mental health issues and drug addiction. Needless to say, with these personal experiences and statistics at hand, I leapt at the oppurtunity to leverage technology to help solve one of the biggest public health crises facing our country today. 

The founders of the company, old friends of mine, asked me for my help a few months back (before I had ever written my first line of code) to develop an idea they had. I gave them as much feedback as I could and we went on our separate ways. A few months later, Chase Merlin, having kept an eye on my progress as a web developer asked me to hop on the project to develop a MVP. 

I had my reservations, as I am relatively inexperienced in mobile development. Despite my misgivings, I was excited to jump into a project that could truly help people! Eventually, we decided to use the Ionic Framework with a Rails API in order to make a MVP - minimum viable product. I am in my first few weeks with the company and have the scaffolding up. Progress with AngularJS has been very quick. As mentioned in a previous post, the most important part of being a web deeloper is *learning to think like a web developer*. The syntax came quickly after that. 

As stated multiple times before, I am excited to work on a cool product. More importantly, I look forward to finally leveraging technology to truly help patients that have nobody else to turn to.
